# Creating Your First Tub

A tub is your primary workspace in QR Tub. It's where you'll organize related lists and manage your items. Think of it as a container that holds different aspects of your items or projects.

## Creating a New Tub

1. From the QR Tub dashboard, click the **Create New Tub** button
2. Enter a descriptive name for your tub (e.g., "Inventory Management")
3. (Optional) Add a description to help team members understand the tub's purpose
4. Choose your tub's visibility settings:
   - **Private**: Only you can access
   - **Team**: Specific team members can access
   - **Public**: Anyone with the link can access

## Organizing Your Tub

### Adding Lists
- Click **Add List** within your tub
- Choose a list type:
  - Grid List (default)
  - Kanban Board
  - Timeline View
- Customize columns based on your needs

### Managing Access
- Go to tub settings (⚙️)
- Click on "Manage Access"
- Add team members and set their permissions:
  - View Only

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the tub's purpose:
- "Equipment-Maintenance"
- "Product-Catalog"
- "Document-Archive"
