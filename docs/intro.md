# Welcome to QR Tub

QR Tub is a powerful tool for managing items through QR codes and organized workspaces. With QR Tub, you can create digital twins for your physical items, making them easily accessible and manageable through a simple scan.

## What is QR Tub?

QR Tub helps you:
- **Organize Items in Grids**: Create and manage items in an intuitive grid layout
- **Generate QR Codes**: Each item gets its own QR code linking to a custom landing page
- **Consolidate Actions**: Create link cards that bring together all actions related to an item
- **Manage Workspaces**: Group related lists in "tubs" for better organization

## Key Concepts

### Tubs
A tub is your workspace where you can organize related lists. Think of it as a container for different aspects of your items. For example, you might have:
- An inventory tub
- A maintenance tub
- A documentation tub

### Lists
Within each tub, you can create multiple lists to track different aspects of your items. Lists are displayed in a grid format, making it easy to view and manage your items.

### QR Codes
Each item in your lists can have its own QR code. When scanned, these codes lead to:
- A custom landing page for the item
- Quick access to important actions
- Relevant information and documentation

### Link Cards
Link cards help you consolidate various actions for an item in one place. You can:
- Create custom actions
- Group related links together
- Provide quick access to important resources
